Make use of functions and control flow to program a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

## Objective
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock,
paper or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more
powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

* Rock destroys scissors.
* Scissors cut paper.
* Paper covers rock.
* If there's a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

Our code will break the game into 3 phases:

1. User makes a choice
2. Computer makes a choice
3. A compare function will determine who wins
